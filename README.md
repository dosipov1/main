The application serves as a user event planner system. There are a few possible roles that offer different functionalities. The user can log in, view events, and register for them. Then, in the task bar on the left side, the user can explore events already registered to. Admin's functionalities differ from the user's. They can create and manage their own events (edit event information or delete an event).
